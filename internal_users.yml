# The logstash user by default has index-level permissions for indices beginning with "logstash-*"
# To work with reactome* indicies, new permissions will need to be added. I've done this in Kibana
# with a new Role that is a copy of the logstash role, with with index permission for "reactome*" indices.
# There's probably a way to do this automatically via yaml config, just need to work that out.
